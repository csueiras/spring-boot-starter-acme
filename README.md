# Spring Boot Starter ACME

A Spring Boot module that is meant to ease the pain of generating a valid SSL Certificate using the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol.

This project depends on the [acme4j](https://github.com/shred/acme4j) library.

# Fork

Please note that this is a fork from a seemingly abandoned project at [spring-boot-starter-acme](https://github.com/creactiviti/spring-boot-starter-acme). I plan to keep this library as up to date as possible with respect to its dependencies. All code has been moved into a new group id and package structure to make it easier to release it on its own.
I've also added some basic tests, and performed some code "clean up" to standardize the codebase.

Wishlist (things I hope to get to some day):
- Add test coverage to the [CertGenerator](./src/main/java/com/github/csueiras/acme/CertGenerator.java), this is the most important part of this library and its currently not covered in tests.

# Dependencies

This module depends on having `openssl` on the `PATH` to convert the certificate to PKCS12 format.

# Maven

This library will be available in Maven central

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.csueiras</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-acme</artifactId>
  <version>{VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

1. Add the module to your `pom.xml` file as a dependency.

2. Build your project. 

2. Deploy it to a target machine and point your domain name to the IP address of that machine. LetsEncrypt validates your ownership of the domain by making a callback to the `http://your-domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}` endpoint exposed by this module.

3. Make sure that your server has `openssl` available on its `$PATH`.

4. To activate `spring-boot-starter-acme` and generate a certificate execute:

```
sudo java -Dserver.port=80 -Dacme.enabled=true -Dacme.domain-name=<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME> -Dacme.accept-terms-of-service=true -jar mysecureapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

5. Check your console for a confirmation that the certificate was successfully generated.

6. Stop your application and configure it to make use of the generated certificate:

```
server.port=443
server.ssl.key-store=keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=password
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
```
